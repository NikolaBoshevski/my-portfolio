This project was meant only for mobile users, not desktop. The main goal of this application was to provide artists with a way to auction and show off their artwork. Also you can log in as a guest and bid on the auction for an artwork. Unfortunately i did not finish this project the whole way. The auction section is not done so unfortunately it cannot be used. But most of the data is dynamic which i am fetching from a local js file called "data.js".
